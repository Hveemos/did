# did
A Stata package that acts as a wrapper for Callaway and Sant'Anna's R did package. This makes heavy use of the [rcall](http://github.com/haghish/rcall) package by Haghish.

Currently, this package is usable but has only part of its functionality. More functions will be added soon.

You can install **did** with `net install did, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickCH-K/did/master/")`. Then run `didsetup` in Stata.
