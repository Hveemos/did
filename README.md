# did
A Stata package that acts as a wrapper for Callaway and Sant'anna's R did package. This makes heavy use of the [rcall](http://github.com/haghish/rcall) package by Haghish.

This project is currently in development and is not yet usable.

You can install **did* with `net install did, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickCH-K/did/master/")`. Then run `didsetup` in Stata.
