{synopthdr}
{synoptline}
{syntab:Main}
{synopt:{opt tvar}} The name of the column containing the time periods.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt gvar}} The name of the variable in data that contains the first period when a particular observation is treated. This should be a positive number for all observations in treated groups. It defines which "group" a unit belongs to. It should be 0 for units in the untreated group.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt clearR}} Start a new R environment before running {cmd: did::att_gt}.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt replace}} Replace the data in memory with the primary results table, rather than returning it only as a matrix.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt no_panel}} By default, estimation assumes the data is a panel, which should be provided in long format â€“ that is, where each row corresponds to a unit observed at a particular point in time. When using a panel dataset, the {opt idname} must be set. With {opt no_panel}, the data is treated as repeated cross sections.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt idname(varname)}} The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt allow_unbalanced_panel}} Whether or not function should "balance" the panel with respect to time and id. Without this option, att_gt will drop all units where data is not observed in all periods. The advantage of this is that the computations are faster (sometimes substantially).{p_end}
{synopt:{opt control_group(string)}} Which units to use the control group. The default is "nevertreated" which sets the control group to be the group of units that never participate in the treatment. This group does not change across groups or time periods. The other option is to set control_group("notyettreated"). In this case, the control group is set to the group of units that have not yet participated in the treatment in that time period. This includes all never treated units, but it includes additional units that eventually participate in the treatment, but have not participated yet.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt anticipation(integer)}} The number of time periods before participating in the treatment where units can anticipate participating in the treatment and therefore it can affect their untreated potential outcomes. By default 0.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt alp(real)}} The significance level, default .05.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt no_bootstrap}} Compute standard errors analytically rather than with multiplier bootstrap. If standard errors are clustered, then do not use this option.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt no_cband}} Do not compute a uniform confidence band that covers all of the group-time average treatment effects with fixed probability 1-{opt alp}. This option does nothing if you have also included {opt no_bootstrap}{p_end}
{synopt:{opt biters(integer)}} The number of bootstrap iterations. 1000 by default. Does nothing if {opt no_bootstrap} is specified.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt clustvars(varlist)}} A vector of variables to cluster on. At most, there can be two variables (otherwise will throw an error) and one of these must be the same as idname which allows for clustering at the individual level.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt est_method(string)}} The method to compute group-time average treatment effects. The default is "dr" which uses the doubly robust approach in the {browse "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DRDID/index.html": DRDID R package}. Other built-in methods include "ipw" for inverse probability weighting and "reg" for first step regression estimators. In R this option also allows custom treatment-effect estimation functions, but if you know how to do that you're probably using R and not this wrapper! So that doesn't work here.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt pl}} Whether or not to use parallel processing (not implemented yet).{p_end}
{synopt:{opt cores(integer)}} The number of cores to use for parallel processing, by default 1 (not implemented yet).{p_end}
{synoptline}
{p2colreset}{...}

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd: att_gt} computes average treatment effects in DID setups where there are more than two periods of data and allowing for treatment to occur at different points in time and allowing for treatment effect heterogeneity and dynamics. See Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) for a detailed description.

Note that {it: all variable names must be legitimate variable names in R as well}. This isn't generally a problem though.

Note that this syntax example produces some strange {cmd: effectSE} results, but this is an artifact of the not-well-thought-out analysis; generally they won't all be identical.
